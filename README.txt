This was my A Level Computer Science Coursework and recieved an A*. We were able to choose an area of interest to focus on and I chose machine learning.

Its goal was to train a neural network without the use of any external libraries with gradient decent to be able to perform OCR of addresses on letters. 

Unfortunately, by the end of the project, I was unable to get the system to reliably distinguish between letters. However, my main goal was to learn and understand the inner workings of machine learning which I was successful in.

I do aim to revisit this topic in the future and will work up from a simpler usage of neural networks
